let tipDiscrip = ["Donâ€™t use cheap VTXs if you want to race. This is the most important one for beginners â€“ to the extent that most races put a requirement on it. The problem with the cheap ones is that they spray all over the frequency band and mess up other racers video feeds. Avoid the ones with huge SMA connectors sticking out the back, and the ones that donâ€™t support Smartaudio or Tramp. For a racing quad you should avoid SMA antennas altogether and use their smaller MMCX or even better U.FL versions.\n\n> What I recommend is the $30 and up range like the TBS Unify Pro HV 5G8 â€“ Race paired with a TBS Triumph Pro U.FL. Need something smaller? Thereâ€™s the TBS Unify Pro 5G8 V3 (SMA), implying that you replace the U.FL to SMA pigtail with a U.FL antenna. Whatâ€™s nice about the TBS ones is they work well if youâ€™re using Crossfire or Tracer. This saves you a lot of headaches when it comes to setting up Smartaudio. You just solder the VTX Smartaudio wire directly to the Nano RX of your choice. And then you can change your VTX settings on your radio using TBS Agent Lite or with the screen on the back of the Crossfire LITE module if thatâ€™s the one you happen to be using. Or even directly on your goggles if youâ€™re using a TBS Fusion receiver module.\n\n> If youâ€™re using ImmersionRC Ghost, a good choice of VTX is the tried and true Tramp Nano. Disclaimer: I havenâ€™t tried Ghost or Tracer, Iâ€™ve only ever flown on Crossfire, so Iâ€™m not a 100% sure on how it works, but Ghost should have a way to change the VTX settings.\n\nBut why is Smartaudio/Tramp a must? Because the classic way to change VTX settings is to wire it to the FC, using up a UART port, then having to set it up on the FC (VTX tables?ðŸ˜±)\n\n so that you can go through the struggle of navigating the OSD in your goggles every time you need to change your VTX settings.","","","",""]
